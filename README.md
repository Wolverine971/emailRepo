# EmailRepo


This is a simple email app I built to play with that lets you send emails.

This app uses an AngularJS with an email controller and an email service to send out an email request.

It hits the url in my EmailApiController in C# which runs a task function in an emailService class. This sends out a simple email using send grid.
